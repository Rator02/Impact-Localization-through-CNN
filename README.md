# Impact-Localization-through-CNN
There are several NDI (Non destructive inspection) techniques for the purposes of structural health monitoring. Through this project, we are trying to build a 2D CNN model to predict the location of an impact on an aircraft's body, through pre processing the time series data we got from 4 Piezo-electric sensors.
